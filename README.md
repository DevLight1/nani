What's Crunchyroll?

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Features
- Fast, modern and responsive interface
- Stream\* and search anime
- Manage your queue
- Much more...
<sub>* Streaming will not work on many newer shows from the website, sadly Crunchyroll is adding CORS headers. I'm working on a public solution for this.</sub>

## Development

```sh
yarn start
```

## Building
To build static files, run
```sh
yarn build
```
