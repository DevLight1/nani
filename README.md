## Features
- Fast, modern and responsive interface
- Stream\* and search anime
- Manage your queue
- MyAnimeList updating support
- Much more...

<sub>* Streaming will not work on many newer shows from the website, sadly Crunchyroll is adding CORS headers. I'm working on a public solution for this.</sub>

## Development
